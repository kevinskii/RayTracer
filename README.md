# RayTracer
This repository contains the working code for Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing" eBook series that can be found here:

The code is mostly just copied from the book examples, with minor changes in organization and a few other small changes to get rid of compiler warnings. I've put it in a public repository in case anyone needs to refer to it while debugging their own code. It doesn't (and isn't intended to) reflect object-oriented best practices.
